# Kernel-level certification of the paper's headline theorems via leanprover/comparator:
# statement-identity against `Adic spaces/Comparator/Challenge.lean`, axiom budget
# [propext, Quot.sound, Classical.choice], and kernel acceptance.
#
# Prerequisites (one-time):
#   git clone https://github.com/leanprover/comparator /tmp/comparator
#   cd /tmp/comparator && lake build            # its toolchain matches this project exactly
#   # the lean4export artifact lake fetches is a Linux ELF; build it natively instead:
#   git clone https://github.com/leanprover/lean4export /tmp/lean4export
#   cd /tmp/lean4export && git checkout \
#     $(python3 -c "import json;print([p['rev'] for p in \
#       json.load(open('/tmp/comparator/lake-manifest.json'))['packages'] \
#       if p['name']=='lean4export'][0])") && lake build
#
# On Linux, install the real landrun (github.com/Zouuup/landrun) for sandboxing.
# On macOS, comparator's own scripts/fake-landrun.sh shim is used (no sandbox — acceptable
# here: the "solution" is this repository's own code, not an adversarial submission).
#
# The script cds to the repo root itself, so it can be invoked from anywhere.
#
# CONFIG selects which certificate to run; the challenge/solution modules are read from it:
#   default  — Adic spaces/Comparator/comparator-config.json   ([FJP] Theorem 1.1 = thm:main)
#   also     — Adic spaces/Comparator/wp-config.json           ([WP] Theorem 8.1, the
#              weighted-parity example)

# challenge's oleans were not produced by a run that had already seen the solution.

# Comparator itself re-runs `lake build` on each module inside landrun (`safeLakeBuild`), which
# is why `Solution.lean` is a small forwarding file rather than a library module: only the
