# Comparator certification: the two sheafy-but-not-stably-uniform examples

Kernel-level certification, via
[`leanprover/comparator`](https://github.com/leanprover/comparator), of the two headline
theorems of [*Uniform sheafy Tate rings that are not stably
uniform*](https://cbirkbeck.github.io/uniform-sheafy-tate-domains/) (Birkbeck–Torzewski):

* **[[FJP] Theorem 1.1](https://cbirkbeck.github.io/uniform-sheafy-tate-domains/#thm-main-1-1)**
  (`thm:main`; the finite-jet pinching algebra): `𝓐 = JetA F` is a complete uniform Tate
  domain, nonnoetherian, sheafy, and **not stably uniform** — the bad chart acquires a
  nilpotent.
* **[[WP] Theorem 8.1](https://cbirkbeck.github.io/uniform-sheafy-tate-domains/#thm-second-example-1-1)**
  (the weighted-parity algebra): `𝒜 = WPA K id` is a complete uniform Tate domain,
  nonnoetherian, `𝒜° = 𝒜₀`, **strongly sheafy**, and **not stably uniform** — with the bad
  chart an integral domain, so the failure of stable uniformity is *not* caused by a
  nilpotent.

**Numbering crosswalk.** The library's docstrings were written against an earlier revision
of the paper and cite these as `[FJP] Thm 1.3` and `[WP] thm 6.2`; in the current revision
they are Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 8.1. The certificate names below follow the current
numbering (`fjp_1_1_*`, `wp_8_1_*`).

| file | role |
|---|---|
| `Challenge.lean` | [FJP] Thm 1.1: the five statements, each `:= sorry` |
| `Solution.lean` | the same five, forwarded to the library's proofs |
| `comparator-config.json` | `theorem_names` + `permitted_axioms` for the above |
| `WPChallenge.lean` | [WP] Thm 8.1: the seven statements, each `:= sorry` |
| `WPSolution.lean` | the same seven, forwarded to the library's proofs |
| `wp-config.json` | `theorem_names` + `permitted_axioms` for the above |
| `../../scripts/certify.sh` | one-time setup instructions + the run |

`certify.sh` reads the challenge and solution module names out of the config, so:

```sh
bash scripts/certify.sh                                        # [FJP] Theorem 1.1
CONFIG="Adic spaces/Comparator/wp-config.json" \
  bash scripts/certify.sh                                      # [WP] Theorem 8.1
```

## What comparator checks, and what it buys over `#print axioms`

For each name in `theorem_names`, comparator (1) rebuilds the solution module in a sandbox,
(2) checks the solution's statement is **structurally identical** to the challenge's — the
statement is pinned in a file the solution does not get to edit, (3) checks the axiom set is
within `propext / Quot.sound / Classical.choice`, and (4) replays the proof through the Lean
kernel. `#print axioms` alone answers only (3), and only relative to whatever statement the
library happens to declare; it cannot tell you that `X` says what you think it says.

## Toolchain

This branch pins **Lean `v4.33.0` (stable) + mathlib `v4.33.0`** — the first stable release
line carrying the fix for kernel soundness bug
[leanprover/lean4#14576](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/14576) (unchecked
projections via phantom-parameter nested inductives; fixed in
[#14577](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/14577), 2026-07-28). The comparator binary
itself builds on the same `v4.33.0` toolchain, so the judging kernel and the judged
development agree.

## The trust boundary

Each challenge imports only the **definition layer**, and its import closure provably
contains none of the modules that prove the statements being judged:

* `Challenge.lean` imports `FJP.FiniteJetRings` + `Uniform`. Closure: 107 project modules,
  containing no `FJP.*` beyond `FiniteJetRings` and `RestrictedLaurent` — in particular
  none of `FiniteJetMain`, `FiniteJetSheafyEndpoints`, `FiniteJetSheafTransfer`,
  `FiniteJetChart`, `FiniteJetUniformDomain`, `FiniteJetNoetherianVertices`.
* `WPChallenge.lean` imports `WP.Algebra` + `SheafyRing` + `Uniform`. Closure: 118 project
  modules, containing no `WP.*` beyond `Algebra`, `Weight`, `RestrictedComplete` — in
  particular none of `WP.Main`, `WP.Sheafy`, `WP.UniformDomain`, `WP.Nonnoetherian`,
  `WP.Chart`, or the reducedness chain.

Do not "fix" a mismatch by importing more here. That trades away the only property these
files exist to provide.

Two statement-spelling conventions keep proving-layer names out of the trusted side:

* the paper's weight `w = id` is spelled `fun k => k` in both WP files — the library
  abbreviation `idWeight` lives in the proving module `WP/Main.lean`;
* the WP statements sit on the layer-2 base (`[IsDiscreteValuationRing 𝒪[K]]`), where the
  uniformizer is chosen by the solution (`Uniformizer.ofDVR`) rather than carried as data.

## Why `Solution.lean` is a separate file and not the library module

Comparator runs `safeLakeBuild solutionModule` — it rebuilds the solution **inside
landrun**. Pointing `solution_module` at a library module would rebuild the entire project
inside the sandbox and conflate "the untrusted submission" with "the project". The
challenge declares neutral names (`fjp_1_1_*`, `wp_8_1_*`); the solution declares the same
names and forwards each to the library's proof.

## Status (2026-08-10, Lean v4.33.0 + mathlib v4.33.0)

```
$ bash scripts/certify.sh
...
Running Lean default kernel on solution.

Your solution is okay!        # exit 0
```

**[FJP] Theorem 1.1 — all five statements certified** (statement pinned against
`Challenge.lean`, kernel-accepted, axioms within `propext / Quot.sound /
Classical.choice`): `fjp_1_1_isSheafy`, `fjp_1_1_isUniform`, `fjp_1_1_isDomain`,
`fjp_1_1_not_isNoetherianRing`, `fjp_1_1_not_isStablyUniform`.

This includes the two statements (`isSheafy`, `not_isStablyUniform`) that were **not**
certifiable in the 2026-08-01 run on `dev/adic-spaces`: there, an anonymous
`NonarchimedeanRing` witness resolved differently between the challenge and solution
environments (the generic instance lived in `FiniteJetFunctoriality.lean`, outside the
challenge's closure). The instance now lives in the definition layer
(`FiniteJetRings.lean`), so every environment containing `JetA` elaborates the headline
statements to structurally identical types.

**[WP] Theorem 8.1 — all seven statements certified** (`wp-config.json`):
`wp_8_1_isUniform`, `wp_8_1_isDomain`, `wp_8_1_not_isNoetherianRing`,
`wp_8_1_powerBounded_eq_unitBall`, `wp_8_1_isSheafyComplete`, `wp_8_1_stronglySheafy`,
`wp_8_1_not_isStablyUniform`.

## Running it

```sh
bash scripts/certify.sh     # from the repo root
```

The script documents the one-time setup (clone + build comparator and lean4export; the
`lean4export` artifact lake fetches is a Linux ELF, so build it natively). On Linux install
the real `landrun` for sandboxing; on macOS comparator's own `scripts/fake-landrun.sh` shim
is used — no sandbox, which is acceptable here because the "solution" is this repository's
own code rather than an adversarial submission.
