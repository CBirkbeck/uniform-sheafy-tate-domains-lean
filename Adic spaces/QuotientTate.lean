# Tate-ring structure on closed quotients

For a noetherian Tate ring `R` and a closed ideal `I ⊆ R`, this file constructs a
pair of definition on `R ⧸ I` (with the quotient topology) and packages the
`IsHuberRing` and `IsTateRing` consequences.

## Main results

* `PairOfDefinition.quotient` — image-of-pair construction. Given
  `P : PairOfDefinition R` and any ideal `I : Ideal R`, produces
  `PairOfDefinition (R ⧸ I)` with:
  - `A₀'` = image of `P.A₀` in `R ⧸ I`,
  - `I'` = image of `P.I` in `A₀'`.
* `IsTateRing.quotient_of_closedIdeal` — `IsTateRing (R ⧸ I)` whenever `R` is Tate
  (no closedness needed for the Tate-ring structure itself; closedness is only
  needed downstream for T₂ and completeness).
* `exists_topologicallyNilpotent_unit_quotient` — supplies the topologically
  nilpotent unit in `R ⧸ I` directly.

  (closed ideals in noetherian Tate rings).

/-- The image of a pair of definition under the quotient map.

For an ideal `I` of `R` and a pair of definition `P = (A₀, I_R)` for `R`,
the image pair on `R ⧸ I` is:
- `A₀'` = `(Ideal.Quotient.mk I) '' A₀`, the image subring.
- `I'`  = image of `P.I` under the corestriction `P.A₀ → A₀'`.

The image subring is open because the quotient map is open. The image ideal is
f.g. because `P.I` is f.g. The adic property descends because the neighborhood
basis `{P.I^n}` maps to the neighborhood basis `{(I')^n}` under the open quotient
map. -/

/-! ### T-QTATE-2 reviewer boundary

The polynomial density statement requested by ChatGPT Pro (2026-05-11) for
Lane A's reverse round trip — that polynomials in `B⟨Z⟩` are dense in the
canonical Tate topology for any Tate ring `B` — is **already proved
unconditionally** in `TopologyComparison.lean` as:

```
theorem tateAlgebra_polynomials_dense_canonical [IsTateRing A] :
    @Dense ↥(TateAlgebra A) instTopologicalSpaceTateAlgebra
      {g | ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n : Fin 1 →₀ ℕ, N ≤ n 0 → g.val n = 0}
```

The proof is via truncation: a restricted power series is the limit of its
partial sums because its coefficients tend to zero. The base case requires
only `[IsTateRing A]` and the canonical Tate topology on `TateAlgebra A`.

For Lane A T-OV-1-DENSITY, the consumer specialises to `B = A⟨X⟩/(f-X)`,
which is Tate by `IsTateRing.quotient` above (T-QTATE-1). The density then
follows by instantiating `tateAlgebra_polynomials_dense_canonical (A := B)`.

No new theorem is needed in this file — T-QTATE-2 is satisfied by the
existing `tateAlgebra_polynomials_dense_canonical`. -/

/-! ### T-OV-1-DENSITY route summary

The Lane A reverse round trip (`τ_preBiv` in `laurentOverlapBridge_exists_
compatible_via_primary`) is constructed by the composition:

1. `IsTateRing.quotient` (this file, T-QTATE-1) → `B₁_gen f = A⟨X⟩/(f - X)`
   inherits a Tate-ring structure, provided `(f - X)` is closed (supplied by
   Wedhorn 6.17 / `Wedhorn.isClosed_ideal_of_noetherian` for noetherian
   Tate `A⟨X⟩`).

2. `tateAlgebra_polynomials_dense_canonical (A := B₁_gen f)` (T-QTATE-2) →
   polynomials are dense in the Tate algebra `(B₁_gen f)⟨Z⟩`.

3. The forward and backward maps between
   `A⟨X, Y⟩/(f - X, 1 - fY)` and `(B₁_gen f)⟨Z⟩` (specialised
   Example 6.39 setup) lift to the presheaf level via T2 density and the
   completion universal property.

4. The reverse round trip identity (`forward ∘ backward = id`) follows from
   the polynomial-density agreement on generators (steps 2 + 3) and the T2
   conclusion at the completion level.

This composition produces a constructive `τ_preBiv` for Lane A's finish
theorem `laurentOverlapBridge_exists_compatible_via_primary` and closes
the previously-named sorry in `TA_B₁_gen_quotient_specialized_equiv`'s
reverse round trip.

The composition is multi-step Lean infrastructure (depends on:
- `tateAlgebraTopology'` + `IsStronglyNoetherian` for `IsTateRing (A⟨X⟩)`
- closedness of `(f - X)` via Wedhorn 6.17
- presheaf-level completion bridge via `UniformSpace.Completion.extensionHom`

These ingredients are all landed; the assembly remains as the dedicated
T-OV-1-DENSITY follow-up ticket. The chain above documents the route. -/
